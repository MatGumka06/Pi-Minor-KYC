# Pi-Minors-KYC
The Pi_Minor_KYC project is mainly focused on the improvement and education of the people, who are slightly younger that the common, adult users of the Pi Network. Currently the utmost priority of the development of the network and the cryptocurrency itself is surely based on the PI coin use among the common-use services, like crypto trade markets or cryptocurrency wallets. Right now, only a limited amount of users is able to use the full potential of what Pi Network guarantees so far. The environment's quality increase will be achieved by reducing the restrictions regarding the age of the PI Coin users in the mainnet. Not only it improves the network's functionality, but also educates younger people in the fields of responsible participation in trade-related activities and increases the potential knowledge of cryotocurrencies. In our concept, underage users of Pi Network would be verified exactly in the same way as the current adult users are verified, probably with the use of a passport of an international ID. If you want to guarantee the young people the improvement of their skills, don't hestitate to share your opinion about the project, and optionally let us know what could we improve!
